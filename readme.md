# Haxe TodoMVC Example (with jQuery)

Haxe is a staticly-typed programming language that can be transpiled to Javascript, PHP, Java, C++, C# or Python or compiled into Flash or Neko bytecode.  Haxe has the unique advantage of code-sharing between all manner of clients and servers even though they run different servers, languages or architectures.

_[Haxe - haxe.org](http://haxe.org)_

This demo shows the basics of how to develop client-side Javascript apps in Haxe.  Many details are included in the comments of src/todomvc/App.hx.While the Haxe standard library exposes standard Javascript and DOM APIs, we advise using a library that abstracts these since direct DOM manipulation can be verbose and unnecessarily complex.  In this example, we use jQuery.

## Building

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the jQueryExtern extern with haxelib by running `haxelib install jQueryExtern`.
3. Compile Haxe source with `haxe build.hxml`
